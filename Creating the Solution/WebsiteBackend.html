			<p id="special">Oceans make up more than 70% of the surface area of our planet. These oceans and other bodies of water are hosts of many different ecosystems and wildlife. However, these diverse ecosystems are in danger. Global warming, pollution, and overfishing have all contributed to the declining health of underwater life and ecosystems. The goal of this site is to educate and raise awareness about the dangers posed to life underwater. Interesting Facts:
			- Over three billion people rely on marine and coastal ecosystems for their wellbeing
			- Oceans absorb 30% of all human produced carbon dioxide, buffering the effects of global warming
			- Marine fisheries employ 200 million people
			- Some sources say that acidity of the oceans has increased by 26% since the industrial revolution
			This shows that we need to protect life underwater. We need to protect life underwater. How? There are several ways to start. Firstly, raise awareness about the plight of our oceans.

			<p>Most of my information for this project comes from the UN site on sustainability goal 14: Protecting Life Underwater. This is my primary source in this project, however it can be argued that it is a secondary source. Link: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/ I also used a few secondary sources, such as the following article by the Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/since-2016-half-the-coral-in-the-great-barrier-reef-has-perished/558302/. Another great secondary source is this website from the World Wildlife Foundation: http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/oceans/problems/climate_change/. There is also an option to donate on this page.
