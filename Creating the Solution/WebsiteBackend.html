			<p id="special">Oceans make up more than 70% of the surface area of our planet. These oceans and other bodies of water are hosts of many different ecosystems and wildlife. However, these diverse ecosystems are in danger. Global warming, pollution, and overfishing have all contributed to the declining health of underwater life and ecosystems. The goal of this site is to educate and raise awareness about the dangers posed to life underwater. 

			Interesting Facts:
			- Over three billion people rely on marine and coastal ecosystems for their wellbeing
			- Oceans absorb 30% of all human produced carbon dioxide, buffering the effects of global warming
			- Marine fisheries employ 200 million people
			- Some sources say that acidity of the oceans has increased by 26% since the industrial revolution
